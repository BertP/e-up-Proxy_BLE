## 1. Context & Objective

**System/Application:** e-up!Proxy

**Hardware:** ESP32-WROOM-32 Module (Proxy) & MeatPi OBD Wican Dongle (STN2120 / ESP32-based OBD2 Wi-Fi Dongle).

**Core Objective:** The ESP32 acts as an intelligent bridge (Proxy). It dynamically switches between the Wican Dongle's Access Point (to fetch OBD2 telematics from the VW e-up!) and the Home Wi-Fi network (to flush the cached data to a local MQTT broker).

**Key Challenge:** Reliable state-machine handling for Wi-Fi switching, non-blocking network scanning, persistent data buffering, and providing a lightweight local diagnostics interface.

---

## 2. Technical Baseline & Environment

- **Target Hardware:** ESP32-WROOM-32 (Onboard Blue LED mapped to GPIO 2).
- **Development Framework:** Arduino IDE / PlatformIO (C++)
- **Deployment System User:** bert
- **External Dependencies:** PubSubClient (MQTT), ArduinoJson, WebServer.h (Native ESP32 WebServer), LittleFS (for log file storage and data buffering).

---

## 3. Strict Constraints & Guardrails

> ⚠️ **CRITICAL RULES — NEVER VIOLATE:**

- **Non-Blocking Logic:** Do NOT use `delay()`. All timing (60-second intervals, LED blinking, connection timeouts) must use `millis()`-based non-blocking execution.
- **Watchdog Timer:** Enable the ESP32 hardware Watchdog (WDT) to ensure the module self-recovers if a Wi-Fi connection loop hangs.
- **File System Safety:** Close file handles immediately after reading/writing to prevent corrupting LittleFS.
- **WSL Build & Flash Guide:** Prior to executing any build, compile, test, or flash command, the AI agent MUST read and strictly adhere to the multi-platform instructions and step-by-step developer guidelines compiled in [wsl_build_guide.md](file:///wsl.localhost/Ubuntu-22.04/home/bert/projects/e-up!Proxy/artifacts/wsl_build_guide.md).
- **Language/Naming Standard:** Even though instructions may be discussed in German, all code, comments, variables, function names, and network variables must be written entirely in English using standard industry naming conventions.

## 4. AI Agent Workspace & MCP Tooling

### Available MCP Capabilities
- **Filesystem:** Full access to `src/`, `include/`, `platformio.ini`, `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `artifacts/`, `SPEC.md`. Do NOT read, create, or modify files outside these paths unless explicitly instructed by the user.
- **Terminal:** Use only for `pio run` compile checks and flash commands (see Section 7). Do not execute other shell commands unless explicitly requested.

### Autonomous Iteration Loop — STRICT LIMITS

1. Implement the requested feature or fix.
2. Run `pio run` once to check for compiler errors.
3. If errors are present: fix the root cause and re-run — **maximum 3 attempts total**.
4. If still failing after 3 attempts: **STOP immediately.**
   - Report the exact compiler errors and the attempted fixes to the user.
   - Do NOT attempt further autonomous fixes.
   - Wait for explicit user instruction before continuing.

### Tool Call Discipline
- Never chain more than 3 tool calls without a user confirmation checkpoint.
- Before any tool call, ask internally: "Is this strictly necessary for the current task?"
- Do not use web search unless explicitly requested by the user.
- Do not read files that are not directly relevant to the current task.

### Documentation Updates
- Update `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` only when explicitly asked, or at end-of-session upon user request.
- Do NOT auto-update documentation after every code change.
- `CHANGELOG.md` format: `YYYY-MM-DD - <concise description of change>`

---

## 5. Definition of Done (DoD)

- [ ] The code compiles without warnings for the ESP32-WROOM target.
- [ ] State machine handles abrupt loss of Wican Wi-Fi gracefully without crashing.
- [ ] LED patterns switch instantly based on the active state.
- [ ] The `GET /debug` page successfully dumps the measurement logs when on Home Wi-Fi.
- [ ] The log file never exceeds the 50 KB boundary.
- [ ] `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` are initialized and up to date.

---

## 6. Agent Guardrails & Scope Constraints

### Clarification First
- If a task or requirement is ambiguous, ask **one clarifying question** before taking any action.
- Do not assume intent and proceed silently.
- Do not start coding before the scope of the requested change is unambiguous.

### Scope Lock
- Work only on the explicitly requested feature or file.
- Do not refactor unrelated code, rename variables for style reasons, or add unsolicited improvements.
- Do not expand scope ("while I'm at it...") without explicit user approval.

### Minimal Footprint
- Prefer the smallest change that satisfies the requirement.
- Avoid chained writes across multiple files unless the task explicitly requires it.
- If a task can be solved by modifying one function, do not restructure the entire module.

### Confirmation Checkpoint
- If completing a task requires more than 3 tool calls, **pause first**.
- Output a concise plan (what files will be changed and why).
- Wait for explicit user confirmation ("yes", "go ahead") before proceeding.

### Session Summary
- At the end of each working session, output a concise summary in **3–5 bullet points**:
  - What was implemented or changed.
  - What was intentionally left unchanged.
  - Any open issues, compiler warnings, or follow-up tasks.

## 7. Build & Flash Environment (WSL2 / Windows 11)

### Development Environment & Multi-Platform Flashing

- **Host OS:** Windows 11
- **Primary Toolchain:** WSL2 (Ubuntu) — all build operations run natively inside WSL2 for maximum filesystem performance.
  - *FileSystem Performance warning:* Running Windows PlatformIO (`pio`) on files residing inside the WSL2 network share (`\\wsl.localhost\...`) is extremely slow due to the 9P virtual network protocol overhead. Always compile inside WSL2 using the WSL terminal.
- **Project location:** Inside the WSL2 filesystem (e.g. `~/projects/e-up!Proxy`).
- **OTA Flashing Network Dynamics (NAT vs. Bridged Mode):**
  - *WSL NAT Mode (Default):* In default NAT mode, the ESP32 cannot route connections back to the WSL virtual IP (which is behind a NAT). OTA uploads triggered from within WSL will fail with `No response from device` after authentication.
  - *WSL Bridged Mode:* If WSL is explicitly configured in "bridged mode", it obtains a direct IP address in the local subnet (e.g., `192.168.1.x`), allowing the ESP32 to communicate with it.
  - *Recommended Fallback:* If bridged mode is not active or experiencing routing issues, copy the compiled `.bin` file to the Windows host and run `espota.py` natively from Windows PowerShell to ensure direct IP-to-IP local connection.

### ⚠️ CRITICAL OTA SOFTWARE & HARDWARE CONSTRAINTS (OTA Lock Prevention)
To prevent creating an "OTA Lock" (where the device crashes and becomes impossible to flash over the air), these rules must be strictly obeyed in the code:

1. **NO Flash/LittleFS Writes in OTA Callbacks:**
   - *Hardware Conflict:* Accessing the filesystem (such as calling `logEvent` which opens/writes to `/debug.log` on LittleFS) inside `ArduinoOTA` callbacks (`onStart`, `onEnd`, `onError`) is strictly forbidden. 
   - *Crash Mechanism:* While the flash controller is locked/in-use for writing the incoming application binary, any concurrent flash write attempt to LittleFS triggers a severe hardware cache/exception error, causing the ESP32 to crash instantly.
   - *Rule:* Only use direct serial output (`Serial.println` or `Serial.printf`) inside all `ArduinoOTA` callbacks.

2. **Watchdog Fütterung (WDT Feed during OTA):**
   - Writing 1.1MB of firmware to flash takes more than 30 seconds. Without feeding the watchdog, the hardware watchdog timer (`WDT_TIMEOUT_S 30`) will trigger a system reset.
   - *Rule:* Always register the `ArduinoOTA.onProgress` callback and call `feedWDT()` inside it to continuously keep the watchdog fed during the flash write.

3. **Block Network Disconnections during OTA:**
   - The state machine's periodic Wi-Fi rescan checks (e.g., every 5 minutes) must be blocked while an OTA upload is in progress.
   - *Rule:* Use a safeguard flag (`otaInProgress`) set in `onStart` (and cleared in `onError`) to ignore any scan timers or transition requests that would otherwise disconnect the Wi-Fi.

### USB Hardware
- **Device:** CH9102 USB-to-Serial adapter (VID `1a86`, PID `55d4`), forwarded from Windows to WSL2 via `usbipd`.
- **Fixed device path in WSL2:** `/dev/ttyACM0` — this is the **only** path to check. Do NOT scan for alternative ports (`/dev/ttyUSB0`, `/dev/ttyUSB1`, etc.).

### Background: Why a Login Shell Is Required

PlatformIO's `pio` binary lives at `~/.platformio/penv/bin/pio`. This path is only added to `$PATH` when the user's profile files (`~/.profile`, `~/.bashrc`) are loaded — which only happens in an **interactive login shell**. When an agent invokes commands non-interactively, those profile files are skipped and `pio` is not found.

The fix is to force a login shell with `bash -l`, which loads the user environment correctly.

### Build Command

> **CRITICAL**: You (the AI Agent) are **ALREADY running natively inside WSL2 (Linux)**.
> Do **NOT** prefix any commands with `wsl` or `wsl -d Ubuntu-22.04`. Doing so will cause the terminal to hang and fail.

```bash
bash -l -c "pio run"
```

- `bash -l` — starts a login shell, loading `~/.profile` and the PlatformIO `$PATH`
- `-c "pio run"` — runs the build and exits

This is the sole compile step. Do not invoke `arduino-cli`, `make`, `cmake`, or any other build tool. Do NOT run `pio run` without the `bash -l` wrapper — it will fail with `command not found`.

### Flash Procedure — STRICT PROTOCOL

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Priority Rule:** If the ESP32 is physically connected or available via USB (CH9102 Serial device `/dev/ttyACM0` present), **USB Serial Flashing ALWAYS takes precedence and priority over OTA Flashing.** OTA should only be used when the device is deployed remotely and USB is unavailable.

> ⚠️ The ESP32 is not permanently connected. Always verify the device before flashing.

1. **Pre-flash Version Control Requirement — mandatory prior to any flash:**
   Before triggering any upload or flashing command, ensure that a Git commit and a Git push (`git push`) have been successfully executed. The commit message **must** explicitly reference and include the new firmware version currently declared in `include/version.h`.

2. **Check device presence — mandatory second step:**
   ```bash
   ls /dev/ttyACM0
   ```

3. **If `/dev/ttyACM0` is NOT present:**
   - Report to the user: "ESP32 not detected on /dev/ttyACM0. Please connect the device and ensure usbipd has forwarded the USB port to WSL2."
   - **STOP. Do not attempt to flash.**

4. **If `/dev/ttyACM0` IS present:**
   - Ask the user explicitly: "ESP32 detected on /dev/ttyACM0. Flash the new firmware now?"
   - Wait for explicit confirmation ("yes", "flash it", or equivalent).
   - Only then run:
     ```bash
     bash -l -c "pio run --target upload --upload-port /dev/ttyACM0"
     ```

5. **Never flash autonomously.** Flashing always requires a Git commit/push verification, device check, and explicit user confirmation, regardless of context.

### Artifacts & Build Output

Due to a known WSL2/Antigravity 2.0 rendering issue, agent-generated artifacts (plans, reports, summaries, binaries) are often not visible in the Antigravity UI — only their title appears. To work around this, **every artifact must always be written as a regular file inside `artifacts/`** in the project root. This is mandatory, not optional.

**Rule: Never create an artifact that only exists as an Antigravity UI artifact. Always write the file to `artifacts/` first.**

| Artifact type | Filename pattern |
|---|---|
| Implementation plan | `artifacts/implementation_plan.md` |
| Session summary | `artifacts/session_summary_YYYY-MM-DD.md` |
| Firmware binary (current) | `artifacts/firmware.bin` |
| Firmware binary (versioned) | `artifacts/firmware_YYYY-MM-DD.bin` |
| Build report / compiler output | `artifacts/build_report_YYYY-MM-DD.txt` |
| Any other markdown report | `artifacts/<descriptive_name>.md` |

After a successful `pio run`, always copy the firmware binary:
```bash
wsl -d Ubuntu-22.04 --cd /home/bert/projects/e-up!Proxy bash -l -c \
  "cp .pio/build/esp32dev/firmware.bin artifacts/firmware.bin"
```

For text artifacts (plans, summaries, reports): write them directly to `artifacts/` using the filesystem tool. Do not rely on the Antigravity artifact panel as the sole delivery mechanism.

### usbipd Reference (for user, not agent)
The following Windows-side commands are for the user to attach/detach the ESP32 to WSL2.
They are NOT executed by the agent:
```powershell
# Attach ESP32 to WSL2 (run in Windows PowerShell as Admin)
usbipd attach --wsl --busid 3-2

# Detach
usbipd detach --busid 3-2
```
